Simply captcha

Every time my clients ask me a form with captcha but when I provide it one (eg. re-captcha) I ever heard the same story: "it's too big! I don't like it! Can you change it?"
So, I have decided to make a new one, very simple to use and develop into your code, and not so "horrible" ;)

Thata is the first release

Description:

index.php -- is the file where the captcha form and checking, at the moment the form action call the same page
captcha.php -- is the function that generate the image with a randomic alfanumeric code
captcha.png -- is the image base used by captcha.php
function.incl.php -- is the repository the code
